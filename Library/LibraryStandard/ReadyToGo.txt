To Do 
[X] *.sln file on the root folder
[ ] src folder in root folder for individual projects
[ ] tst folder for unit test projects
[X?] .vs should be ignored in gitignore
[X] change default enum
[ ] move enum definitions outside of Person class (one item per class)
[ ] flagged enum in person in case person is librarian and author   https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.flagsattribute?view=netframework-4.8
[X] protected virtual _MakeUsername
[ ] SearchBookByAuthor return Books.Where(c => c.AuthorName.Contains(name)).ToList(); ToList creates a new list, so won't damage list from catalog
[?] Make Books private
[X] Make BookBuilder class
[X] fix comment public List<Book> SearchBookByName( string title)
[ ] CatalogLoader or CatalogBuilder entity.
[ ] Make Catalog singleton or static
[ ] Look up how Linq works
[X] write down differences singleton class static class             http://net-informations.com/faq/netfaq/singlestatic.htm
    Static class:                                       Singletong Pattern:
    - Only allows static methods                        - Allows all kinds of methods
    - Cannot by itself be passed as a param             - Can be passed as a param
    - Does not allow to inherit from interface          - Allows inheritance
    - Cannot be handled polymorphically;not acc to OOP  - Can be handled polymorphically; acc to OOP
    - Stored in stack                                   - Stored in Heap
    - No constructor                                    - Can have constructor
    - Does not allow disposal                           - Does allow disposal   
    - Does not allow cloning                            - Does allow cloning
